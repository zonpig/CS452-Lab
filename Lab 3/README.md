For Lab 3, we started by using RotatingCube.js and RotatingCube.html as our basis. Once we had that set up we decided to use a tetrahedron. We implemented rotations first. We did this by putting in buttons for rotation that the user can use and 
using matrices to make the shape rotate on an axis based on what button is pressed.
