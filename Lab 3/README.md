# Lab 3: 3D Transforms

Done by:

Mustapha Jom - Made the tetrahedron, made the tetrahedron have interpolated colors on the faces, and made the rotation functions.

For Lab 3, we started by using RotatingCube.js and RotatingCube.html as our basis. Once we had that set up we decided to use a tetrahedron. We implemented rotations first. We did this by putting in buttons for 
rotation that the user can use, which also indicates the letters that the user can use to rotate the tetrahedron with the parentheses(('x' key), ('y' key), ('z' key)). We used matrices to make the shape rotate on an axis based on what button is pressed or the key that is pressed.
-
X - rotates the tetrahedron on the x-axis

Y - rotates the tetrahedron on the y-axis

Z - rotates the tetrahedron on the z-axis
